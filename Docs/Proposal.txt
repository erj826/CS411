Project Proposal:

Ideas:

1. Apartment Fantasy Sports
For this app, we will take user input to generate a fantasy league for whatever the user wants. For example, this could be
fantasy "Bachelor in Paradise" or fantasy "Intramural Soccer". A user will fill out a form with a set of players, a set of
rules, and a set of associated point values. Our database will include at least two tables: one for users and their scores in
given competitions, and many for rules and point values associated with generated competitions. The APIs we are going to use
are Braintree (to handle payment for entering competitions) and Facebook (to provide users with the opportunity to like and
share their competitions or results). We may also use a news API to make suggestions for possible competitions for our users.
The user and their friends will have the option to buy in to contests, and the app will generate and keep track of a game for
them. A given contest will have an admin that is responsible for updating the score.


2. Political Crash Course






3. My Songs Are Better
This web app will allow users to go head to head and compete to see who's got a better playlist. Similar to Fantasy Football,
users will draft a lineup of 10 songs. At the end of a one week period, two lineups will be compared to see who received more
listens that week. Get more listens than your competitor, you win. We will also add an option to restrict which songs or 
genre's can be used in a given contest, or offer a random category generator to add a challenge for users. Our database will
contain users and rosters for a given week. We will also allow users to listen to their friend's playlists. We are going to accomplish this by using the Spotify API, and the Facebook API. At the end of a week (or other pre-specified period of time) the winner will be announced and friends will be able to see the results.
