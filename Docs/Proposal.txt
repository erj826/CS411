Project Proposal:

Ideas:

1. Apartment Fantasy Sports
For this app, we will take user input to generate a fantasy league for whatever the user wants. For example, this could be
fantasy "Bachelor in Paradise" or fantasy "Intramural Soccer". A user will fill out a form with a set of players, a set of
rules, and a set of associated point values. Our database will include at least two tables: one for users and their scores in
given competitions, and many for rules and point values associated with generated competitions. The APIs we are going to use
are Braintree (to handle payment for entering competitions) and Facebook (to provide users with the opportunity to like and
share their competitions or results). We may also use a news API to make suggestions for possible competitions for our users.
The user and their friends will have the option to buy in to contests, and the app will generate and keep track of a game for
them. A given contest will have an admin that is responsible for updating the score.


2. Political Crash Course
